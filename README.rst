.. Change things from this point on

This library contains data types, exceptions, functions and utilities common to
Mistral, python-mistralclient and mistral-extra repositories. This library also
contains the public interfaces for 3rd party integration (e.g. Actions API, YAQL
functions API, etc.)

If you want to use OpenStack in your custom actions or functions, you will also
need to use https://opendev.org/openstack/mistral-extra.
