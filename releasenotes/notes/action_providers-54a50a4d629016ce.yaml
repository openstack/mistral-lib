    Added the new infrastracture that will allow to manage Mistral actons
    in a much more flexible way. It is based on the action provider concept.
    An action provider is responsible for delivering actions to Mistral.
    Mistral cluster administrators can plugin multiple action providers
    that will deliver actions in their own way, possibly using different
    backend storages, caching techinques and so on. Along with the
    ActionProvider interface there has been added the ActionDescriptor
    interface that carries meta information about an action and responsible
    for instantiating the action. Also added base convenient classes.

    Fixed a number of typos and logical mistakes in docstrings and also
    added the exception class ActionException that actions can raise
    in case of their internal errors. Mistral will be handling those
    exceptions starting from the Victoria official version.
